                <th> Video segmentation, detecting objects in pixel level, is a basic step for many visual task as it provides a preliminary understanding of a scence. For instance, in robotics, if we can find out each objects and their categories, it faciliates the analysis of the environment and hence helps robots to reach better policy. Recently, many successful deep learning based method for image semantic segmentation have been proposed. However, all these methods assume categories are given so that training data with semantic labels can be used for supervised learning, which limits their usage on new domains. In order to have a automatic procedure for discovering categories, we look into videos, sequences of images, rather than a single image. In video, we have not only appearance information but also motion information, which can be represented as optical flows. We use several sequences as training data, where we perform unsupervised video segmentation. From this segmentation, we analyse similarity of segmented objects according to both thier appearance and motion, so we can cluster them into categories. With these generated categories, we can convert unsupervised segmentation result into semantically labeled training data, finally we use this generated data to train a semantic segmentation model. </th>
